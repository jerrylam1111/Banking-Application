# Banking-Application

## Project Goal
The main goal of the project is to develop a working interactive software prototype for bank employees. Our team of six engineers will develop a banking system for the bank employees to manage the customer accounts and banking services in a safe and efficient manner through the use of encryption and compression of data.

## Technical Requirements 
+ We can only use standard C libraries including stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h and math.h
+ We must not use any other libraries that come with GCC or developed by other programmers
+ The user can log into the banking system
+ The user can check bank account details and transfer/withdraw money
+ Account information are encrypted and compressed

## Program Features
###General Programming
The code followed the recommended guidelines as per the assignment description. This included creating sub-functions and thoroughly commenting so the code is easily understandable as well as pointing out the errors in the code and highlighting necessary sections.

### Encryption
The encryption checks if the password is correct using XOR cipher. The XOR compare a string with the password.

### Compression/Decompression
A bank is a large organisation with a lot of user data. Therefore, compression of large files is important. Compression will prevent the data saved from taking up too much space. 

### Exclusions 
This project is just an initial version of a bigger product. This program has the basic functionality including encryption and compression. If we had more time to work on this project, we could have included more functions, such as change password, and extra features to make a more appealing user interface.
